# Helpful
---
A simple WordPress plugin that adds a 'was this post helpful'-question below your posts.

This plugin is created by [Giel Berkers](http://gielberkers.com) and is described in the tutorial '[How to create a WordPress plugin](http://gielberkers.com/tutorial-create-wordpress-plugin/).

## Installation

Installation is easy, just add the plugin to your WordPress installation, activate it, and you're ready to go!

## Theming

If you want to edit the themes used by this plugin, copy the files located in the plugins' `templates`-directory to your theme directory in a folder called `helpful`. For example, if you want to make changes to the form, cop `wp-content/plugins/helpful/templates/form.php` to `wp-content/themes/your_theme/helpful/form.php`.

## Styling

The plugin doesn't have styling out of the box, so that's something you still have to do yourself. This is planned however for a future update.
